## The text editor jail

It was a very simple one, we were given a vi terminal just had to break from it and access the flag.
Simply ran the command

```bash
:!/bin/sh
```

and now I have a shell, found a file `run_for_flag`. I did exactly what is asked me to do "ran it for the flag" and guess what I got the flag.

## An impossible number

Well, there's no way a number exists which is greater than itself after one is added to it. It's mathematically and logically incorrect.
So the only logical solution in this case was to overflow the "int". I chose the greatest integer that can be assigned in C and used that as input to obtain the flag.
