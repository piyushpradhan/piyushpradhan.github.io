I"[<p>In the past week, I’ve been spending my time playing around with cloud services, deploying random stuff just to try and figure out how it’s being used.
I also wanted to have a vulnerable environment to try and extract something that isn’t usually made available.
It was then when I stumbled across this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flaws.cloud</code>.</p>

<p>It is basically a cloud CTF, deployed on AWS. Explains about some common misconfigurations and how to take advantage of those mistakes.</p>

<h3 id="finding-the-subdomain-that-contains-s3-bucket-for-flawscloud">Finding the subdomain that contains s3 bucket for <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flaws.cloud</code></h3>

<ul>
  <li>AWS S3 buckets follow this pattern</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bucket-name.s3.region.amazonaws.com
bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, a little bit of google dorking will be enough</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>flaws.cloud site:s3.amazonaws.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p><strong>S3 Buckets should configured so that they are not publicly available. If the bucket policy is modified to allow everybody “s3:GetObject” privilege, then anyone can access the bucket.</strong></p>

<p>The first link had the contents of the s3 bucket in XML format
I thought I’ll be able to find something interesting in robots.txt file…
<img src="/assets/images/flaws-cloud/xml-in-bucket.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>but…
<img src="/assets/images/flaws-cloud/robots-contents.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Looking further I found something that actually was a hint
<img src="/assets/images/flaws-cloud/actual-hint.png" alt="" />
<strong>secret-dd02c7c.html</strong> was the page I was looking for.
That page gave me the link to the <strong>Second Level</strong></p>

<p>For this challenge, use of <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">aws-cli</code> was required.</p>

<p>Setting it up is fairly easy, take the <strong>Secret Key</strong> and <strong>Access Key</strong> from your own AWS account and use those to configure awscli profile</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>aws --profile configure &lt;profile-name&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>After that just enter the keys and an output format.</p>

<p>Now, that we have an AWS account and the bucket url we can try to list the contents of the bucket.</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>aws s3 --profile &lt;profile-name&gt;
</code></pre></div></div>
