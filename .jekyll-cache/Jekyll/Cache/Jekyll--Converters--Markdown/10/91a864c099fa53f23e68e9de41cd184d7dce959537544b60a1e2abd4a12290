<p>First we have the authentication, couldnâ€™t find anything in the first attempt so I decided to register and move on to check for other vulnerabilities.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s an option in dashboard to â€œAdd Site Formâ€ it simply lets me add some url and then ping it. Iâ€™m not sure if this can be exploited but seems pretty interesting, so Iâ€™m going to try something.
It turns out it was actually vulnerable to command injection.</p>

<p>Apparently, the same form is vulnerable to XSS too</p>

<p>Now there is this profile picture upload feature on the update profile page.</p>

<p>Thereâ€™s this robots.txt lying around too, which I should have noticed sooner. It hinting towards another secret or s3cret directory.
I canâ€™t access this directory normally, Iâ€™m just getting redirected to the home page again</p>
