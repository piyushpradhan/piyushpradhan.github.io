I"á<p>In the past week, Iâ€™ve been spending my time playing around with cloud services, deploying random stuff just to try and figure out how itâ€™s being used.
I also wanted to have a vulnerable environment to try and extract something that isnâ€™t usually made available.
It was then when I stumbled across this <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">flaws.cloud</code>.</p>

<p>It is basically a cloud CTF, deployed on AWS. Explains about some common misconfigurations and how to take advantage of those mistakes.</p>

<ul>
  <li>AWS S3 buckets follow this pattern</li>
</ul>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>bucket-name.s3.region.amazonaws.com
bucket-name.s3.amazonaws.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>In this case, a little bit of google dorking will be enough</p>

<div class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge"><div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight"><code>flaws.cloud site:s3.amazonaws.com
</code></pre></div></div>

<p>The first link had the contents of the s3 bucket in XML format
I thought Iâ€™ll be able to find something interesting in robots.txt fileâ€¦
